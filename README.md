# The Implementations of Improved Signal Leakage Attacks 

Run attacks against DXL [DXL12]:
- `make`
- `python3 imp-dxl-pv.py`
- for comparing with the attack [BSV2021], run `python3 compare-dxl.py`

Run attacks against DBS-KE [DBS19]:
- `make CFLAGS="-DVERS=19 -DN=512 -DSTDDEV=41915"`
- run `python3 imp-dbs-ke-pv.py 512`
- for comparing with the attack [BSV2021], run `python3 compare-dbs-ke.py`

Run an attack against LBA-PAKE [DBK2021]:
- `make CFLAGS="-DVERS=20"`
- run `python3 imp-lbapake-pv.py`
