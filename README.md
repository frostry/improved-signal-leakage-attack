# Signal Leakage Attack using Targeted Signal Extraction

This software implements a signal leakage attack against the protocols DXL [DXL12], DBS [DBS19], and LBA-PAKE [DBK21].

The attack is in line with Fluhrers attack [Flu16] that has been improved by Ding, Alsayigh, Saraswathy, Fluhrer, and Lin [DAS+17] and Bindel, Stebila, and Veitch [BSV21] and improves upon them further. More concretely, it views signals as binary codes, enabling a 'target signal extration' approach. Our results caution against underestimating the power of signal leakage attacks.

Run attacks against DXL [DXL12]:
- `make`
- `python3 imp-dxl-pv.py`
- for comparing with the attack [BSV21], run `python3 compare-dxl.py`

Run attacks against DBS-KE [DBS19]:
- `make CFLAGS="-DVERS=19 -DN=512 -DSTDDEV=41915"`
- run `python3 imp-dbs-ke-pv.py 512`
- for comparing with the attack [BSV21], run `python3 compare-dbs-ke.py`

Run an attack against LBA-PAKE [DBK21]:
- `make CFLAGS="-DVERS=21"`
- run `python3 imp-lbapake-pv.py`

For Quantum2FA, we modify the code of [Newhope](https://github.com/newhopecrypto/newhope) to simulate the attack. To run it:
- `cd Quantum2FA`
- `make && ./test_cpakem512`
